# Milestone1
The Personal Expense Tracker API project helps users manage their daily expenses by providing a backend service that allows them to log, retrieve, and analyze their expenses. Here's a breakdown of how the project works:

1. Overview of the Project

The backend of this project is built using Node.js and Express to handle HTTP requests. The project exposes a set of APIs that allow users to:

Log new expenses.

Retrieve a summary of their expenses filtered by categories or date ranges.

Get insights about their spending, such as the highest spending category.

Automatically generate summary reports based on time (daily, weekly, monthly).


2. Key Components of the Application

a. Express Application

The application uses Express, a popular web framework for Node.js, to handle HTTP requests. The Express app listens for incoming requests on a specific port and routes them to the appropriate handler functions.

b. Router and Routes

The router is used to define specific routes for handling different types of requests related to expenses.

POST /expenses: This route allows users to add a new expense.

GET /expenses: This route retrieves a list of expenses, optionally filtered by category or date range.

GET /expenses/analysis: This route provides an analysis of the expenses, such as total spending per category or by time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).


c. Controller Functions

The controller functions are responsible for implementing the business logic of the API, such as:

addExpense: Adds a new expense to the list.

getExpenses: Retrieves expenses based on filtering criteria like category or date range.

analyzeSpending: Analyzes the expenses to give insights, like total amount spent in each category.


d. Data Storage (In-Memory)

For simplicity, this project uses in-memory arrays to store the expenses. In a production setting, you would typically store this data in a database (e.g., MongoDB or SQL), but for now, the expenses are stored in an array in the backend.

e. Automated Reports

Automated reports are generated periodically using node-cron. This allows the system to automatically generate summaries of expenses on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.

3. How the Application Works

Here’s how the flow works when interacting with the API:

a. Adding an Expense

A user sends a POST request to /expenses with details about the expense (e.g., category, amount, and date).

The server processes the request and adds the expense to the in-memory array.

A response is sent back confirming that the expense was added.


b. Retrieving Expenses

A user sends a GET request to /expenses with optional query parameters (e.g., category=food, start_date=2024-01-01, end_date=2024-01-31).

The server processes the request, filters the expenses based on the provided parameters, and returns the relevant expenses in the response.


c. Analyzing Spending

A user sends a GET request to /expenses/analysis to get insights about their spending.

The server analyzes the stored expenses and provides insights like:

Total spending by category.

Highest spending category.

Monthly or weekly spending totals.



d. Generating Automated Reports

The server is set up to automatically generate reports at regular intervals (daily, weekly, or monthly) using node-cron.

These reports summarize the expenses during the given time period and can be used to analyze trends.


4. Detailed Workflow Example

1. Adding an Expense:

A user sends a POST request to /expenses with the following body:

{
  "category": "Food",
  "amount": 15.00,
  "date": "2024-12-02"
}

The server processes the request, validates the data (checks if the amount is positive and category is valid), and adds it to the in-memory array of expenses.

A confirmation response is sent back:

{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Expense added successfully."
}



2. Retrieving Expenses:

A user sends a GET request to /expenses?category=Food to get all food-related expenses.

The server filters the stored expenses by category and returns a list of matching expenses:

{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [
    {
      "category": "Food",
      "amount": 15.00,
      "date": "2024-12-02"
    }
  ]
}



3. Analyzing Spending:

A user sends a GET request to /expenses/analysis to get insights about their spending.

The server processes the request and returns insights, such as total spending in each category:

{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "Food": 15.00,
    "Travel": 20.00
  }
}



4. Automated Report Generation:

Using node-cron, the server is scheduled to automatically generate a weekly or monthly summary report. This is a background task that runs on the server, without user intervention, and produces a report summarizing the expenses over a given time period.




5. Backend Code Structure

Here's a quick overview of the file structure:

6. Summary

The Personal Expense Tracker API is a backend service built using Node.js and Express.

It provides endpoints to add, retrieve, analyze, and generate reports about expenses.

The data is stored in-memory (arrays) for simplicity, but can be expanded to a database.

Automated reports are generated using node-cron for daily, weekly, or monthly summaries.

The app listens on a specific port and handles HTTP requests to track expenses efficiently.
